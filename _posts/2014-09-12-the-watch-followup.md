It should be obvious that the thoughtfulness put into the interface [and hardware][watchguy] is superior to the current Android Wear offerings. However, it's the difference between iOS and Andoid, not between iOS and Blackberry/Window Mobile. When the industry was zigging, I thought Apple would zag. Instead, they just zigged really hard. Oh well.

That's not to say there aren't some great new ideas. Force touch and Taptic engine feedback seem like new ways of doing things that should make for some very nice interactions.

The digital crown seems nice and I’m sure the action is fucking cherry, but Tim Cook positioning it as the next step in the mouse->multitouch evolution is bonkers.

It's kinda chunk, but that's likely a first generation thing. I expect it get get svelt over a few iterations.

It seem that the messenger is going to be the killer app, and that we likely don't know all it can do. There is a hardware button dedicated to it, so it's obvious that Apple sees it as a central pillar to the Watch's appeal.

Wild speculation: we'll see some Beats branded wireless earbuds to go along with the watch when near launch. It'd make for a compelling package for fitness.

Moon face: good. Apple Pay: awesome if adopted. Heartbeat sharing: adorbs. And that Milanese loop tho.

I'm buying one.
