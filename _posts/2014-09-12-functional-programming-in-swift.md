[New book]() from the [objc.io](http://objc.io). I wrote a small game in Swift and aside from a few rough edges in the bridging layer between Obj-C libraries and Swift I've found it to be a pleasure. I'm looking forward to adopting functional programming paradigms in my own code and to the future libraries that are built on top of it.
